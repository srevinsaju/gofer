## Why `gofer` ?
### Why yet another telegram-discord bridge?
Well, I was learning `golang`, and I wanted a project to get my hands dirty on ðŸ˜‚, so a discord-telegram bridge looked like a cool stuff I could make!

### Why the name?
`gofer`, because of its prefix `go-` and because `gofer` is literally known as a messenger / person who runs errands. As `gofer` gets messages from discord and posts them to telegram and vice-versa, it sounded like an appropriate name. Also, fun fact, take a look at [Gopher's page](https://blog.golang.org/gopher) too!
